# Dockerfile Bug: Missing apt-get clean

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: forgetting to include `apt-get clean` after installing packages using `apt-get install`.  This can lead to larger image sizes and potential build issues.

## Bug

The original `Dockerfile` (located in this repository) misses the crucial `apt-get clean` command. This results in unnecessary files from the package installation remaining in the image layers.  This increases the image size and can make subsequent builds slower and more error-prone.

## Solution

The `DockerfileSolution` (also in this repo) demonstrates the correct approach. We've added `RUN apt-get clean` after the package installation to clean up unnecessary files. The solution also improves upon the original file by adding more robust error handling and improved efficiency in managing dependencies.

## How to reproduce the bug

1. Clone the repository.
2. Attempt to build the original `Dockerfile` using `docker build -t my-image .`
3. Observe the image size and any warnings or errors.
4. Compare this with the results of building the `DockerfileSolution` using the same command.

This example highlights the importance of properly cleaning up after `apt-get install` in Dockerfiles to create efficient and maintainable images.
